# Compiler_project

## First Task
In this project, We use **Antlr4 program** to read *if statment* which takes each block and numbering it sequentially.
Once we put an input which contains **nested if** with *True* or *False* condition as input shown :
(You can find it in: () )

**INPUT**

As Input shown, *IF* function contains another *IF* which have an *Print* function. Our Purpose is to put *\\blocknumber + "number of this block"* in each new statment, as shown in the output.

**To make this scenario:**

1- We made a grammer for if statment as you can find in ([If.g4](https://github.com/Asmahan-Rashed/Compiler_project/blob/main/If.g4))
